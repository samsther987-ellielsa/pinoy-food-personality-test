                    <p>Welcome to the Pinoy Food Personality Test! We believe that food is more than just sustenance—it's a reflection of our personality and heritage. Our mission is to blend the scientific approach of the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) with the rich, diverse flavors of Filipino Cuisine.</p>
                    <p>Whether you’re a bold and adventurous Sisig or a comforting and reliable Sinigang, our interactive test helps you discover your "Foodie Alter Ego." To make it even more exciting, we’ve connected each result to K-Pop stars and K-Drama characters who share your personality traits, bridging the gap between Filipino culture and the global Hallyu wave.</p>
                    <h3>Why we built this:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cultural Celebration: To showcase the unique characteristics of Filipino food to a global audience.</li>
                        <li>Interactive Fun: To provide a high-quality, engaging digital experience for the MJ (Millennial & Gen Z) generation.</li>
                        <li>Personal Discovery: To give users a fun way to relate their personality to the dishes they love.</li>
