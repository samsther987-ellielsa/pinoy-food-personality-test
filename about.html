                        <h3>About Pinoy Food Personality Test</h3>
                        <p>Welcome to the Pinoy Food Personality Test! We believe that food is more than just sustenance — it's a reflection of our personality and heritage. Our mission is to blend the scientific approach of the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) with the rich, diverse flavors of Filipino Cuisine.</p>
                        <p>Whether you're a bold and adventurous Sisig or a comforting and reliable Sinigang, our interactive test helps you discover your "Foodie Alter Ego." To make it even more exciting, we've connected each result to K-Pop stars and K-Drama characters who share your personality traits, bridging the gap between Filipino culture and the global Hallyu wave.</p>

                        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                        <p>Filipino cuisine is one of the most diverse and flavorful in the world, yet it often doesn't get the global recognition it deserves. We created this test to shine a spotlight on beloved Filipino dishes by connecting them to personality types that people around the world can relate to.</p>

                        <h3>How the Test Works</h3>
                        <p>Our personality quiz presents you with 16 carefully crafted questions — 4 for each of the MBTI's core dimensions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I):</strong> How you gain energy — from social interaction or solitary reflection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N):</strong> How you process information — through concrete facts or abstract patterns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F):</strong> How you make decisions — through logic or personal values.</li>
                            <li><strong>Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P):</strong> How you approach life — with structure or spontaneity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Questions are randomly selected from a pool of 48, so each test experience feels fresh. Your answers are scored on a 4-point scale and processed entirely in your browser — no data is ever sent to a server.</p>

                        <h3>16 Filipino Food Matches</h3>
                        <p>Each MBTI personality type is paired with a Filipino dish that embodies similar qualities. For example, the disciplined and traditional ISTJ is matched with Adobo — the timeless, reliable staple of every Filipino kitchen. The creative and free-spirited ENFP gets Halo-Halo — a colorful, vibrant mix of flavors and textures.</p>

                        <h3>K-Pop & K-Drama Character Twins</h3>
                        <p>As a bonus, every result also includes a K-Pop or K-Drama character match. This bridges Filipino food culture with the global Hallyu (Korean Wave) phenomenon, creating a unique cross-cultural experience that resonates with fans of both cultures.</p>

                        <h3>Why We Built This</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cultural Celebration:</strong> To showcase the unique characteristics of Filipino food to a global audience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interactive Fun:</strong> To provide a high-quality, engaging digital experience, especially for Millennial and Gen Z audiences.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal Discovery:</strong> To give users a fun way to relate their personality to the dishes they love.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cross-Cultural Connection:</strong> To bridge Filipino food culture with K-Pop/K-Drama fandom through shared personality traits.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The Psychology Behind Food & Personality</h3>
                        <p>Research in behavioral psychology has long explored the relationship between food preferences and personality traits. Studies have shown that people who enjoy bold, spicy foods tend to be more adventurous and sensation-seeking, while those who prefer comfort foods often value stability and emotional connection. Our test builds on these insights by creating meaningful connections between MBTI personality profiles and the characteristics of Filipino dishes.</p>
                        <p>For example, the rich complexity of Kare-Kare mirrors the layered inner world of the INFJ personality type, while the bold heat of Sisig reflects the ENTP's love of intellectual challenge and disruption. These pairings are carefully crafted to resonate with the core traits of each personality type, creating an "aha!" moment that makes personality exploration feel personal and fun.</p>

                        <h3>Filipino Food Culture: A Global Heritage</h3>
                        <p>Philippine cuisine reflects over 400 years of cultural exchange — from indigenous Austronesian cooking methods to Chinese-influenced noodle dishes (pancit), Spanish-era preservation techniques (adobo, longanisa), and American-introduced canned goods and fast food culture. This rich culinary heritage creates one of the most diverse food cultures in Asia.</p>
                        <p>Key values in Filipino food culture include "bayanihan" (community spirit), where cooking and eating are communal activities; "pasalubong" (homecoming gifts), where food serves as a token of love when visiting family; and "handaan" (feasting), where celebrations are defined by the abundance and quality of food served. These cultural values are woven into every dish we feature in our personality test.</p>
                        <p>Today, Filipino food is experiencing a global renaissance, with Filipino restaurants earning international recognition and Filipino flavors appearing on menus worldwide. Our test celebrates this moment by introducing Filipino cuisine to a global audience through the universal language of personality.</p>
