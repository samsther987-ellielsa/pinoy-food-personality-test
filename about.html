                        <p>Welcome to the Pinoy Food Personality Test! We believe that food is more than just sustenance — it's a reflection of our personality and heritage. Our mission is to blend the scientific approach of the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) with the rich, diverse flavors of Filipino Cuisine.</p>
                        <p>Whether you're a bold and adventurous Sisig or a comforting and reliable Sinigang, our interactive test helps you discover your "Foodie Alter Ego." To make it even more exciting, we've connected each result to K-Pop stars and K-Drama characters who share your personality traits, bridging the gap between Filipino culture and the global Hallyu wave.</p>

                        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                        <p>Filipino cuisine is one of the most diverse and flavorful in the world, yet it often doesn't get the global recognition it deserves. We created this test to shine a spotlight on beloved Filipino dishes by connecting them to personality types that people around the world can relate to.</p>

                        <h3>How the Test Works</h3>
                        <p>Our personality quiz presents you with 16 carefully crafted questions — 4 for each of the MBTI's core dimensions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I):</strong> How you gain energy — from social interaction or solitary reflection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N):</strong> How you process information — through concrete facts or abstract patterns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F):</strong> How you make decisions — through logic or personal values.</li>
                            <li><strong>Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P):</strong> How you approach life — with structure or spontaneity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Questions are randomly selected from a pool of 48, so each test experience feels fresh. Your answers are scored on a 4-point scale and processed entirely in your browser — no data is ever sent to a server.</p>

                        <h3>16 Filipino Food Matches</h3>
                        <p>Each MBTI personality type is paired with a Filipino dish that embodies similar qualities. For example, the disciplined and traditional ISTJ is matched with Adobo — the timeless, reliable staple of every Filipino kitchen. The creative and free-spirited ENFP gets Halo-Halo — a colorful, vibrant mix of flavors and textures.</p>

                        <h3>K-Pop & K-Drama Character Twins</h3>
                        <p>As a bonus, every result also includes a K-Pop or K-Drama character match. This bridges Filipino food culture with the global Hallyu (Korean Wave) phenomenon, creating a unique cross-cultural experience that resonates with fans of both cultures.</p>

                        <h3>Why We Built This</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cultural Celebration:</strong> To showcase the unique characteristics of Filipino food to a global audience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interactive Fun:</strong> To provide a high-quality, engaging digital experience, especially for Millennial and Gen Z audiences.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal Discovery:</strong> To give users a fun way to relate their personality to the dishes they love.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cross-Cultural Connection:</strong> To bridge Filipino food culture with K-Pop/K-Drama fandom through shared personality traits.</li>
                        </ul>
